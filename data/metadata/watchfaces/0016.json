Supports english, french, german and spanish.\r\n\r\nWeather is taken from your phone's location by default, or can be manually configured by city name and country code (in case you've denied access to location service). Uses weather forecasts up to 24 hours when your Pebble is running without bluetooth.\r\n\r\nYou can choose between a lot of temperature units in configurations dialog: Fahrenheit, Celsius, Delisle, Kelvin, Newton, Rankine, Réaumur, Rømer.\r\n\r\nWhile watch-wearer is sleeping (detected by \"Pebble Health\"), watchface is automatically switched-off to save energy.\r\n\r\nThe second hand is hidden by default. Shake your wrist to show it for a few seconds. You can configure the second hand to be permanently visible, but this will drain your Pebble's battery more quickly.\r\n\r\nYou can configure \"No date\" watchface complication, or \"Date only\", or \"Weekday and date\" (only on Time Round) in the configurations dialog.\r\n\r\nThe estimated remaining battery hours can optionally be displayed. And there is a battery meter painted in green, yellow or red colors (depending on the Pebble's battery level) between the minute markers at the bottom of the watchface. I find this a pretty cool feature. :)\r\n\r\nThere is a bluetooth icon appearing and double-vibrating when bluetooth connection with phone has been lost.\r\n\r\nAnd there is more to come!

I have added a large date number that is easier to read. \r\n\r\nOn the top the a battery status bar is shown if selected in the configuration. It is meant to be only one pixel high to dominate the watchface as little as possible. When the battery reaches 20 percent or less the percent is shown in the lower right corner. \r\n\r\nThe watchface can be configured to inverse when bluetooth connection is lost. If inverse is not selected an icon is shown in the lower left corner when bluetooth is disconnected.

by a classic watch. It shows hour, minute, second (if you like), date and a multi functional extra dial. The extra dial can be configured to - disappear from the watchface - work as a 24-hour dial which turns once a day, noon is at at position 6. Perfect for cave explorers. - track your activity either steps or time, your daily goal can be configured as well (this for sure needs a supporting Pebble watch and access to Pebble Health). You will start at noon (0%) and will hopefully end at noon (100%). - show a second time zone, just configure the desired difference in minutes. With this feature you can take a journey to even the craziest time zones on our planet. Seconds dial and date display can also be switched on or off, whatever fits your mood. If the Bluetooth connection breaks, the crown changes its color (2nd image). Battery status is realized with the seconds hand (if switched on). Below 40% remaining battery it starts to move every two seconds. Below 30% it moves every 3 seconds and below 20% the dial only moves every 5 seconds.

Also, the denominator is set to 12, which means that the fraction and the percentage are with respect to just the morning (if am); or just the afternoon-night (if pm).\r\n\r\nExamples 3 and 4 show 4:15:30 pm, now, 4/12 represents 33.3% or 1/3 of the afternoon-nigh.\r\n\r\nThe 2nd row shows that 15 min out of 60 are 25.0% or 1/4 of the hour.\r\nThe 3rd row shows that 30 sec out of 60 are 50.0% or 1/2 of a minute.\r\nThe Day of week is 2/7, this is, tuesday.\r\nThe Day of month is 9/31, i.e., the 9th day of a month with 31 days.\r\nThe Day of year is 222/366, i.e., the 222nd day of a (leap) year.\r\nThe Month is 8/12, i.e., august (2/3 of a year)\r\nFinally, the year (2016) is not compared to anything.\r\n\r\nIf you think about it, this is quite a lot of information, which I hope you find useful, or at least interesting.\r\n\r\nEnjoy it :)","developer_id":"5327d89581f6bae5f00000b5","header_images":"","hearts":31,"id":"57aa1bbd693f7ee208000024","latest_release":{"id":"57aa6c0b693f7eb8dd000058","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/iH6XMt0IRCO2MtINJahr","published_date":"2016-08-09T23:50:00.418Z","release_notes":"","version":"1.0"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57aa1bbd693f7ee208000024/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57aa1bbd693f7ee208000024/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57aa1bbd693f7ee208000024/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57aa1bbd693f7ee208000024/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57aa1bbd693f7ee208000024/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/57aa1bbd693f7ee208000024/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/57aa1bbd693f7ee208000024"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/pXDw5NWURFSBKTSIcoBY/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/pXDw5NWURFSBKTSIcoBY/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-08-09T23:50:12.839Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/pXDw5NWURFSBKTSIcoBY/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/HW6m70HQFqNo2DxaUd9i/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/XRCT81XnTivmZ8ZAtZQg/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/ilhtwOC6SQiQuXFsEPon/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"","title":"Percentages","type":"watchface","uuid":"18dd46a4-b546-4017-babc-a111ab5b5f92","website":""},{"author":"Marcin Simonides","capabilities":[],"category_id":"528d3ef2dc7b5f580700000a","category_name":"Faces","category_color":"ffffff","changelog":[{"version":"1.2","published_date":"2016-09-10T11:28:12.852Z","release_notes":""},{"version":"1.1","published_date":"2016-08-10T17:33:11.335Z","release_notes":"Minor fixes."},{"version":"1.0","published_date":"2016-08-09T19:50:38.524Z","release_notes":""}],"companions":{"ios":null,"android":null},"compatibility":{"ios":{"supported":true,"min_js_version":-1},"android":{"supported":true},"aplite":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":3}},"basalt":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":3}},"chalk":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":3}},"diorite":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":3}},"emery":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":3}}},"created_at":"2016-08-09T19:41:50.916Z","description":"An unusual and creative way to tell the time.

year and the host city for that Olympic game edition is shown (this means that edition XXXII, which will be host at Tokyo in 2020, is already included in this watchface).\r\nWhen the current seconds is between 33 and 60, then at the top is shown the current host: 2016 Rio de Janeiro.\r\n\r\nIt also vibrates if it loses or gains bluetooth connectivity.\r\n\r\nExamples show:\r\n00:00:00, 12:48:31, 6:57:19 y 23:59:30.\r\n\r\nBonus: Olympic Games bring people and countries together. \r\nBecause of this, I offer to translate this watchface to your own language, provided that you email me the city

I designed it to enable quick access to data while saving swipes, clicks, and pushes. By sticking to mostly text, the watchface displays a large amount of data while limiting visual clutter. All eight complication slots can be filled or left blank as desired, and complications can be displayed multiple times.\r\n\r\nEight-frame has 12 weather and fitness complications, and most are self-explanatory. The exceptions:\r\n- Wind gauge displays wind speed in mph (Imperial / UK), m/s (Metric), or km/h (Canadian), and appends the bearing\r\n- Precipitation gauge displays chance of precipitation as a percentage, and adds a period or exclamation points to indicate increasing severity.

july\r\noption to disable pattern on analog screen\r\nremoved inner black circle\r\nbatt charging text same colour as scroll text\r\n\r\n\r\nThis came about while working on an update for my original \"Ticker Time\" watchface.  In the end I'd changed so much I've published it as a separate watchface.\r\n\r\nIf you give the watch a shake the analog face disappears and the time/date (as text) scrolls across the screen - then it switches back to analog mode.\r\n\r\nThe battery charge level is indicated by the central ring - it depletes as the charge level decreases.  When the watch is charging, the battery percent level shows in the middle, then disappears when not charging.  The battery ring changes to Red below 40%.\r\n\r\nThe settings page includes,\r\n\r\n- change background colour (analog & text)\r\n- change scrolling text colour\r\n- change hour hand colour (and the small 12 dot)\r\n- change second hand colour\r\n- turn the animation on/off\r\n- bluetooth vibe on/off\r\n- seconds hand on/off\r\n\r\nThe watchface also supports the Pebble app built-in languages (ie. for the scrolling text).","developer_id":"52d76309bd61272345000001","header_images":"","hearts":105,"id":"579574dc50c752b5c90003b4","latest_release":{"id":"579858ed1482cd16ea00006e","js_md5":"9977f026e442d0c798fa46af9d559e26","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/JBkRHmLTYOL7KY1vNsKQ","published_date":"2016-07-27T06:52:45.685Z","release_notes":"option to disable pattern on analog screen\r\nremoved inner black circle\r\nbatt charging text same colour as scroll text","version":"1.1"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/579574dc50c752b5c90003b4/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/579574dc50c752b5c90003b4/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/579574dc50c752b5c90003b4/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/579574dc50c752b5c90003b4/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/579574dc50c752b5c90003b4/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/579574dc50c752b5c90003b4/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/579574dc50c752b5c90003b4"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/rl0JwewkSlCsiXmRQN1u/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/rl0JwewkSlCsiXmRQN1u/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-07-26T03:01:56.877Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/rl0JwewkSlCsiXmRQN1u/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"https://github.com/mereed/pebbleface-ticke2","title":"Ticker 2","type":"watchface","uuid":"16e98366-a436-473e-afd1-6b0464bdb264","website":"http://markreed8.wix.com/pebblefaces"},{"author":"P1X3L","capabilities":[""],"category_id":"528d3ef2dc7b5f580700000a","category_name":"Faces","category_color":"ffffff","changelog":[{"version":"1.2","published_date":"2016-07-29T19:58:08.405Z","release_notes":"Second release!\r\nWhat's New?\r\nChanged Font\r\nFixed Bugs"},{"version":"1.0","published_date":"2016-07-26T00:45:51.025Z","release_notes":"First Release!!!"}],"companions":{"ios":null,"android":null},"compatibility":{"ios":{"supported":true,"min_js_version":-1},"android":{"supported":true},"aplite":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":3}},"basalt":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":3}},"chalk":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":3}},"diorite":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":3}},"emery":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":3}}},"created_at":"2016-07-26T00:37:35.613Z","description":"This watchface is inspired by Amanda Ripley's watch, SAMANI E-125 from the 2014 game Alien:Isolation!

This watchface will help you get all the loots you deserve.\r\n\r\nWith PokeStop Timer you won‘t miss out on a loot anymore. When you activate the PokeStop watchface, a 5 minute countdown will start in an endless loop of 5 minute countdowns. After every 300 seconds your Pebble will vibrate and you can loot your PokeStop again. If you are running out of sync with the timer or you just want to reset it „manually“, press the menu button (middle button = the button on the right site) followed by the back button (back button = the button on the left side) of the watchface. This is also known as „to the menu and back – Move“.\r\n\r\nWhen you are in a bar with friends and want to really loot a Pokemon Go PokeStop, just let your Pebble remind you.\r\n\r\n********************************\r\n\r\nNachdem Ihr euch bei einem PokeStop in Pokemon Go die Belohnungen holt, müsst Ihr 5 Minuten (oder 300 Sekunden) warten bis Ihr wieder Pokebälle, Heilsprays, Eier, etc. bekommen.\r\n\r\nMit diesem Pokemon Go Watchface verpasst Ihr keine Runde mehr.

The 6 markers are ten minute markers.\r\n\r\nIn between the 12 o'clock mark and the 2 o'clock  mark is the AM/PM indicator. The dot is white during the AM and turns black in the PM.\r\n\r\nThe Date is represented by a red circle which resides on the outer ring of 30 + 1 circles. The 10-minute markers make it easier to read the date. For example the marker on the 30th minute indicates the 15th of the month (30÷2=15).\r\n\r\nThe Month resides as a red dot in the central ring. The dot's position on the dial represents the current month. For example, if the dot is on the 6th hour, the month is June. At 2 o'clock the date would be February. At 12 o'clock, its December.\r\n\r\nThe Day of the Week resides at the lower half of the circle as black dots. The current day of the week is represented by a red dot. It starts at the second marker (20 minutes) at Sunday. At the 6th hour mark, it would be Wednesday. On the 8th hour mark it would be Saturday.\r\n\r\nThe watch will vibrate (long-long-short) when bluetooth is disconnected. Or you can disable that behaviour.\r\n\r\nMake it yours by customizing every color or choose from one of the defined themes.\r\nYou can also use a metal texture style of the background color.\r\n\r\nScreenshot examples:\r\n1) Monday, March 31, 11:25 PM\r\n2) Monday, September 1, 3:00 AM\r\n3) Wednesday, November 20, 5:25 AM\r\n4) Saturday, July 23, 12:00 AM\r\n\r\nThe design is inspired by Ludwig Oechslin's Perpetual Calendar.","developer_id":"5722b3d1db5a405aa4000023","header_images":"","hearts":43,"id":"579181dd84242800800002e1","latest_release":{"id":"57f8fec456fda546f1000024","js_md5":"7993be7acc984e8c3d5d51e54c8b8b40","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/sF6HiEmQQcOZXO4nN4FG","published_date":"2016-10-08T14:12:27.776Z","release_notes":"","version":"2.1"},"links":{"add":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/579181dd84242800800002e1/add","remove":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/579181dd84242800800002e1/remove","add_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/579181dd84242800800002e1/add_heart","remove_heart":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/579181dd84242800800002e1/remove_heart","add_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/579181dd84242800800002e1/flags/add","remove_flag":"https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/api/applications/579181dd84242800800002e1/flags/remove","share":"https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/579181dd84242800800002e1"},"list_image":{"80x80":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/HoxDaWQbSD6fXuDm78LA/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=80&h=80","144x144":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/HoxDaWQbSD6fXuDm78LA/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=144"},"published_date":"2016-07-22T02:49:19.659Z","screenshot_hardware":"basalt","screenshot_images":[{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/HoxDaWQbSD6fXuDm78LA/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/0xTgYi8gR8SAP4Errt5G/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/NqQpOZIjR0OY6kxEBoCe/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"},{"144x168":"https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/m2DiwRbcTzCz8HboZlvr/convert?cache=true&fit=crop&w=144&h=168"}],"source":"https://github.com/zealotree/Perpetual","title":"Perpetual","type":"watchface","uuid":"48e3dd66-1f18-4a63-8957-8b21a9d8d86d","website":""},{"author":"S3anD","capabilities":[""],"category_id":"528d3ef2dc7b5f580700000a","category_name":"Faces","category_color":"ffffff","changelog":[{"version":"1.0","published_date":"2016-07-21T20:39:12.194Z","release_notes":""}],"companions":{"ios":null,"android":null},"compatibility":{"ios":{"supported":true,"min_js_version":-1},"android":{"supported":true},"aplite":{"supported":false,"firmware":{"major":3}},"basalt":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":3}},"chalk":{"supported":false,"firmware":{"major":3}},"diorite":{"supported":false,"firmware":{"major":3}},"emery":{"supported":true,"firmware":{"major":3}}},"created_at":"2016-07-21T20:37:45.611Z","description":"A watchface for Team Mystic on Pokemon GO.

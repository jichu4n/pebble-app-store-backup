Hour in 24hr format in the centre of the screen\r\n - Minute denoted by a red dot, on the edge of the dial\r\n - Steps and distance figures, alternating every ten seconds\r\n - A yellow arc denoting battery life\r\n - A blue/green arc denoting steps against average\r\n\r\nThe battery arc runs from the 9pm position to the top.  Hence when the battery is full, the arc runs between 9 and 12.  \r\n\r\nThe green blue arc represents current steps against your daily average (based on last 7 days), so an arc running between 12 and 3 positions shows you have acheived 100% of your average.  A lighter arc running between 3 and 6 positions will show that you have acheived up to 200% of your average.  Anything over this will not be shown.\r\n\r\nThrough configuration, you can change:\r\n - Colours for all elements\r\n - Choose 12hr or 24hr display\r\n - Larger text for hours\r\n - Wider arcs\r\n - Enable/disable battery monitoring\r\n - Enable/disable health monitoring\r\n - Change frequency for steps/distance change over\r\n - Configure which information is shown (None/Steps/Distance/Steps+Distance)\r\n - Configure distance units (miles/km)\r\n - Add steps target\r\n - Configure whether the health arc shows percentage of the target or the daily average\r\n\r\n","developer_id":"569bf201d05afe4cfc00004b","header_images":"","hearts":15,"id":"56be56cf3e48f58058000031","latest_release":{"id":"573b7b229f6e50821400001f","js_md5":"b0df31b0e0c193e79431d52de76845a4","js_version":-1,"pbw_file":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/s45zfLkrRa6ktplS8aJs","published_date":"2016-05-17T20:12:55.431Z","release_notes":"Fix
